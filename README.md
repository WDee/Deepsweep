# Deepsweep
Deepsweep is a supervised machine learning approach for estimating positive selection in whole-genome sequenced data. A manuscript detailing the method is forthcoming. 

## Installation 
The main code is included in a Jupyter Python notebook
The script requires installation of a number of python packages as well as SFS_Code. Further details and information on SFS_Code can be found on http://sfscode.sourceforge.net/SFS_CODE/index/index.html

## Overview
The notebook uses SFS_Code to create a set of isolates, which subsequently are used into a CNN using the Keras library.
